# About me
I am a versatile Software Developer/Engineer with over 18 years of professional hands-on experience and demonstrated success in leading the design, implementation, stakeholder engagement and support of highly reliable mission-critical software systems with real-word impact in dynamic multidisciplinary operational environments throughout all stages of the SLDC. After all of that time working on propriatry solutions, I am creating this GitHub account to build a public-facing portfolio while experimenting and building my skills across various domains. However scant or entry-level it may seem at first depsite my experience, the content found here should be understood to be evolving as I figure out how to best build it out.
